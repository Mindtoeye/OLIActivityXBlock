            <p>In a large lecture hall, students were handed a drawing of a woman. Students didn&#x27;t
                know that those on the left side of the center aisle received a drawing of a young
                woman while those on the right side of the aisle were given a drawing of an old
                woman. A slide was then projected with an drawing that was an ambiguous combination
                of the two handouts and students were asked a series of questions. </p>
